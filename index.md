Keep it short, Stupid!
Think before you touch object prototypes
Avoid mixing with other technologies
Avoid globals
Minimize dom access
Comment as much as needed but not more
Never use "setTimeout" and "setInterval" as alternatives to "eval"
[] is better than "new array();"
Use "let" over "var"
Don't use '=='
